My research focuses on understanding the needs of immigrant students to facilitate English language acquisition and academic success within the K-12 system. I investigate how instructional technology can be leveraged to enhance learning experiences in STEM and language arts, with a specific emphasis on multimodal digital storytelling.

Throughout my academic career, I have explored the intersections of gender and immigration, formative education, and the development of professional identities for teachers. My work often bridges the gap between cognitive and sociocultural insights to create more equitable educational environments.

### Professional Journey
After beginning my career as an educator in Seoul, where I founded the Tip-Top Kids English School to serve low-income districts, I transitioned to higher education in the United States. I have since held faculty positions and visiting scholar roles at institutions including Boston College, the University of South Florida, and Harvard Graduate School of Education.

### Global Impact
I am deeply involved in international educational initiatives, including representing Boston College in working groups with the OECD on the Education 2030 Project. My current projects include a hydroponic Green House initiative with Waltham schools and ongoing research with CityConnects to support emergent bilingual learners.
